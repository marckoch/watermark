# Jetbrains Academy - Version Control System

My solutions for the Jetbrains Academy Problem 'Version Control System'

https://hyperskill.org/projects/222

The solution is build up step by step over several stages. 
Stage 1 is the first and simple one. The following stages 
build up on the previous stages and get more and more advanced.
There are five stages in total.

Because each stage is completely independent of the previous one,
IntelliJ might show some warnings about duplicated code between 
the stages.

## Stage 1

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/222/stages/1112/implement)

Show some image properties.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage1.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 2

Blend two images.

Use alpha channel transparency.

## Stage 4

Use own transparency color.
